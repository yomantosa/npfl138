ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0002.flac	Bread raised with what is known to bakers as a “sponge,” requires more time and a trifle more work than the simpler form for which I have just already given directions.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0003.flac	But it keeps fresh longer, is softer and more nutritious, and a second-rate brand of flour thus treated produces a better loaf
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0004.flac	than when mixed up with yeast and water only.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0005.flac	Sponge-making is, therefore, an important if not an essential accomplishment in a cook, be she novice or veteran.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0006.flac	Three potatoes of fair size, peeled and boiled mealy.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0007.flac	Five tablespoonfuls of yeast. One tablespoonful of white sugar.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0008.flac	One tablespoonful of butter.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0009.flac	Three cups of lukewarm water in which the potatoes were boiled, strained through a coarse cloth.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0010.flac	One heaping cup of sifted flour.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0011.flac	Put the potatoes into a large bowl or tray and mash them to powder with a potato beetle, or a wooden spoon.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0012.flac	While still hot, mix in the sugar and butter, beating all to a lumpless cream.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0013.flac	Add a few spoonfuls at a time, the potato-water alternately with the flour by the handful,
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0014.flac	beating the batter smooth as you go on until all of the liquid and flour has gone in.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0015.flac	Beat hard one minute before pouring in the yeast.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0016.flac	it is well to stir into the yeast a bit of soda no larger than a grain of corn already wet up in a teaspoonful of boiling water.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0017.flac	Now whip up the batter with a wooden spoon for another minute, and the sponge is made.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0018.flac	Throw a cloth over the bowl and set by for five or six hours to rise.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0019.flac	If you intend to bake in the forenoon, make the sponge at bedtime. If in the afternoon, early in the morning.
ljspeech_tiny/lj020-0020.flac	When the sponge is light sift a quart and a cup of flour into a bowl or tray with two teaspoonfuls of salt.
